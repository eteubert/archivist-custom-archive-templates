Shortcode Plugin to display an archive by category, tag or custom query. Customizable via HTML templates.

== Description ==

= Quick Start =

The plugin assumes your articles are well categorized.
To display the archive, use the shortcode anywhere in a page or article.

	[archivist category="kitten"]
	[archivist tag="kitten"]

Replace "kitten" with your category/tag. Watch out, we need the slug here.
That's the name without capital letters and spaces.

= Placeholders =

You can specify a custom template to display the archive elements.
Go to `Settings > Archivist` for plugin preferences.
Use HTML and any of the following template placeholders.

- `%TITLE%` - The post title.
- `%PERMALINK%` - The post permalink.
- `%AUTHOR%` - The post author.
- `%CATEGORIES%` - The post categories as unordered list.
- `%CATEGORIES|...%` - The post categories with a custom separator. Example: `%CATEGORIES|, %`
- `%TAGS%` - The post tags with default separator.
- `%TAGS|...%` - The post tags with a custom separator. Example: `%TAGS|, %`
- `%EXCERPT%` - The post excerpt.
- `%POST_META|...%` - Any post meta. Example: `%POST_META|duration%`.
- `%POST_META|...|...%` - Any post meta list, separated by custom HTML. Example: `%POST_META|guest|<br>%`
- `%DATE%` - The post date with default format.
- `%DATE|...%` - The post date with custom format. Example: `%DATE|Y/m/d%`
- `%POST_THUMBNAIL|...x...%` - The post thumbnail with certain dimensions. Example: `%POST_THUMBNAIL|75x75%`
- `%COMMENTS%` - The post comment count.

= Filter by Query =

Are you feeling bold? Is filtering by category or archive not satisfying you? Read on, I've got a challenge for you.
WordPress uses a certain query syntax to define the so called loop which is used to display the archive.
You can find the complete documentation at http://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Query 
and you can take advantage of every single parameter or combination of parameters listed there. Some examples:

	[archivist query="year=1984&author_name=gorwell"]
	
Lists all entries from the year `1984` by the author with `user_nicename` `gorwell`.

	[archivist query="tag=straw+mask&post_status=private&orderby=comment_count&order=DESC"]
	
Lists all entries marked with post status `private` which are tagged with both `straw` and `mask`, ordered by the amount of comments in a descending order.

= Using multiple Templates =

When you install the plugin, there is just one templated called "default".
If you don't specify a specific template in the shortcode, this one will be used.
Therefore the following two shortcodes yield identical results.

	[archivist category="kitten"]
	[archivist category="kitten" template="default"]
	
You can add as many templates as you like. Think twice before deleting one. If it's still in use, the archive can't be displayed.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `archivist` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Place `[archivist category="kitten"]` in your archive post or page

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= W00t, it says I need PHP 5.3?! =

PHP 5.3 is available since June 2009.
It introduced some long overdue features to the language and I refuse to support legacy junk.
Please ask your hoster to update, kindly.

= Can I help to add a feature? =

That would be awesome!
